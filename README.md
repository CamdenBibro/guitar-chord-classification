# guitar-chord-classification
This project focuses on classifying guitar chords using spectral audio data.

Guitar chords are incredibly diverse, with over 2,500 commonly used chords. For the initial phase of this project, we are starting with a subset of these "common chords," with plans to expand and include more as the project evolves.
