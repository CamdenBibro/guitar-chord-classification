# guitar-chord-classification
This project focuses on classifying guitar chords using spectral audio data.

Guitar chords are incredibly diverse, with over 2,500 commonly used chords. For the initial phase of this project, we are starting with a subset of these "common chords," with plans to expand and finetune on niche chords if the model can correctly classify these 132 basic chords.

You can help this project by following this link and recording yourself play a few chords on guitar!
The web-app works great on chrome (desktop). I am working on making it functional on ios and safari.
